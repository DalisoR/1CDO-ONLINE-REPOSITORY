    <div class="chapter">
        <h2>CHAPTER ONE: THE LUMPA UPRISING</h2>
        <p>The formation and establishment of the Zambia Army's Special Forces Corp is traced back to 1965 when a Special Military Group tasked to conduct special operations that are a primary mandate of the Special Forces was formed. The group known as ''Dog Force'' was formed on 30 November 1965 to undertake an operation codenamed ''Stallion''. The group was commanded by its advocate, Major E C J Dowling. Initially, Major Dowling could not garner support given the fact that the Army was still in its infancy with the country only having obtained its independence a year earlier on 24 October 1964. Therefore, Zambia Army was still reorganising and realigning its structure and priorities respectively.</p>
        <p>However, the Lumpa Church uprising emerged as a threat that could only be dealt with the Special Forces that the country did not have at the moment. Alice Mulenga Lenshina's influence that transcended the territorial borders of Zambia posed a threat to internal and external aggression. She had thousand followers in Belgian Congo (now Congo DR), Tanganyika (now Tanzania) Nyasaland (Malawi) Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) and much more within her birth country Northern Rhodesia (Zambia). In Northern Rhodesia, she commanded a huge following from Chinsali her home village where she established the Lumpa Church. She also had followers in other neighbouring towns and provinces.</p>
        <p>Lenshina was born in 1920 to Mr Lubusha a veteran of WWI and a messenger for the colonial administration. Her mother was Musungu Chimba. She was born with the name Mulenga Lubusha and was later given Alice as her baptism name. She was also given the name ''Regina'' a latin word meaning mother or Queen. Locals pronounced Regina as Lenshina. All her followers referred to her as ''mother'' due to the role she played in their social and spiritual lives. Thus, she was popularly known as Lenshina.</p>
        <p>Lenshina was born in Kasoma village of Chinsali district. She was a member of the United Free Church of Scotland which was based at Lubwa. Though most of the leaders were Europeans, it had natives who worked as missionaries for the Church. One of the Missionaries for the Church was David Kaunda the father to Dr Kenneth David Kaunda who later became the First president of the Republic of Zambia.</p>
        <p>Lenshina was a loyal member of the church until 1953 when she got ill and went into a coma. While in a coma she claims to have received a vision and direction from God to open up a Church that would carry a different message from the one being preached by the White Fathers of Roman Catholic Church, United Scotland Church and the Watchtower that were dominant churches in Chinsali.</p>
        <p>Lenshina's new teachings resulted into doctrinal conflicts with those of the United Church of Scotland. Her teachings co-opted the African traditions and customs that had initially been dubbed evil by the colonisers and missionaries who believed were in Africa to civilise the natives. Her message began attracting large numbers of congregants. The United Church of Scotland was against keeping Lenshina as their devout member due to her new teachings that were alien to the church and more so that she was a woman. Women were not allowed to teach or preach in church.</p>
        <p>Therefore, in 1954, Lenshina left the United Church of Scotland and began her new movement. Hundreds of local people that had been westernised by the European Missionaries by convincing them that African culture, traditions and African names were evil, soon realised the need of worshipping a God that would accept their ways of life. While the missionaries called her a heretic, locals called her the light of the word of God, a mother and a Prophetess.</p>
        <p>Lenshina advocated for women rights that were being trampled down at that time by the colonial masters. Women were not allowed to take leadership roles and were thus restricted to performing duties of house wives. Women were further not allowed to teach or preach in church. Lenshina advocated for women to be allowed in taking part in running the affairs of the church and communities.</p>
        <p>In 1955, Lenshina formed her own church called Lumpa. Lumpa is a Bemba word that means ''above all else'' or Superior. By naming the Church Lumpa, she was spreading a message that the newly founded church was above the other churches; the United Church of Scotland and the Roman Catholic Church both of which were suffering defections of worshippers to the Lumpa Church.</p>
        <p>Initially, the two churches were at rivalry in recruiting new members. However, the coming of the Lumpa Church saw a mass exodus from the two churches. Within a year, Lenshina had baptised more than 5,000 followers. Therefore, the Lumpa Church was considered a threat to the expansion and existence of the two Churches. By 1964, the Lumpa Church was the fastest growing church in Africa. The first battle line against the two missionary churches was drawn.</p>
        <p>Lenshina's movement became popular with her divine powers of overcoming witchcraft. Those that gave heed to her message brought their charms which she burnt. Her message of salvation and redemption was primarily to get rid of all witchcraft in the communities.</p>
        <p>In 1957, the followers built a very large church in Kasoma village. It was commissioned the following year in 1958. The magnificent Cathedral built from burnt pan-bricks was named ''Uluse Kamutola Cathedral'' a place where souls were to find rest. The Cathedral was bigger than both the Roman Catholic Church and the United Church of Scotland's Cathedrals or church buildings.</p>
        <p>The cathedral was considered a threatening statement from the Lumpa Church to the missionary churches as well as the colonial administration that was working closely with the missionaries in ensuring the natives were loyal and obedient to the authorities.</p>
        <p>More than a thousand followers every week made their pilgrimage to Kasoma village that housed the Lumpa Church. Lenshina called the place ''Sion'' Zion signifying that Kasoma was the actual place where Jesus would descend to during his second coming. To date, the place is known as Zion Kasoma.</p>
        <p>The Lumpa Church therefore, grew in numbers and faith. Thousands of followers-built churches around their respective villages but were loyal in making pilgrimages to Zion where they gave offerings of thanksgiving. Pilgrims from Tanganyika (Tanzania), the Belgian Congo (Congo DR), Nyasaland (Malawi), Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) and those in different towns within the country dated the sanctuary every week in search of salvation, comfort and hope.</p>
        <p>Lenshina's message of freedom from oppression led to the clashes between her followers and the Northern Rhodesian Government. She instructed her members to break the yoke of slavery by refusing to pay taxes to authorities. She commanded her followers to only pay tax in form of tithes and offerings to God through her church. This brought her in direct confrontation with the administration as failing to pay tax was an imprisonable offence.</p>
        <p>The coming of the militant United National Independence Party (UNIP) which had just broken away from the African National Congress (ANC) on the scene did not make things any better as the Lumpa Church often clashed with UNIP Zealots in the district and province. The Lumpa church was considered a major threat to UNIP which was on the way in forming government as the Church's agitations against the colonial administration were similar to that of other political parties.</p>
        <p>The other reason of clashing was the Church member's refusal in taking up civic duties including voting. UNIP desperately needed all the natives to cast their votes if they were to win the elections. They were thus labelled as troublemakers that needed to be dealt with decisively.</p>
        <p>Lenshina with her followers publicly burnt their Identification Cards rendering them ineligible to vote. The act was considered sabotage against UNIP that was seeking the country's political independence.</p>
        <p>Lenshina's followers also boycotted attending any meetings that were called by either the Colonial Administration or UNIP. Lenshina urged her followers to be self-productive by engaging in ventures that would give them an easy life independent of government handouts. The worshippers were encouraged to engage in agricultural activities. Therefore, the battle line was drawn.</p>
        <p>Due to the continued clashes between UNIP Zealots and Lenshina's followers, the latter relocated to Kasoma village, the headquarters of the Lumpa Church. They built a modern village where houses were in perfect rows and each one with a clean pit latrine in the backyard. The village was orderly. In the village, no one was allowed to smoke any type of cigarette, drink alcohol or to engage in a polygamous marriage. The village established their own courts that were free of corruption and injustice.</p>
        <p>This sent a negative message to the local chiefs and the administration. The local chiefs were aggrieved on the fact that the worshippers built the village without their approval. The administration and UNIP considered the self-governance of the Lenshina's followers as the beginning of secession of the Lumpa from Northern Rhodesia. They feared it might lead to a civil war as was the case with some neighbouring countries hence further delaying the independence of the country.</p>
        <p>Alice Lenshina therefore, became the enemy of the missionary churches, local chiefs, colonial administration and UNIP. In anticipation of the worst, the worshippers barricaded their village with a stockade leaving entrances that were guarded day and night.</p>
        <p>The Colonial Administration drew up strategies that would limit the growth and influence of the Lenshina Movement as it had the capacity to spiral out of control threatening the peace and security of the country. Therefore, the Northern Rhodesia Police intensified their Patrols in areas where Lenshina held much influence. However, the measure taken by the Colonial Administration resulted into many clashes between the administration and the followers of Lenshina. The continued clashes heightened the conflict between the two parties leading to many fatalities.</p>
        <p>On 24 July, 1964 a patrol team led by Derek Smith was attacked as they went into Chapaula village. Chapaula was a very large village that had a huge follower for Lenshina. While others escaped wounded and filled with fear and terror, the patrol team leader, Derek Smith was killed. After getting his body, Chinsali District Commissioner John Hannah described Smith's death as having being caused by several stabs inflicted on him by locals using their spears.</p>
        <p>Such clashes and loss of lives from the government, Lenshina's followers and UNIP Cadres continued. Every day bodies of murdered locals were picked in homes, fields and roadsides. While others were shot to death, some were hacked by pangas or stabbed by spears with some torched to flames. Though methods of murder varied, most of the victims died painful deaths. There was not even a single sign that such would come to an end early.</p>
        <p>Therefore, the administration responded by moving a large number of police officers and soldiers from Lusaka and deployed them in Chinsali. The Security wings cordoned Zion Kasoma village that housed the Lumpa Church and opened fire on Lenshina's followers. More than 700 followers were shot to death. The massacre led to most of her followers take refuge in Belgian Congo, Tanganyika and with many relocating to other towns.</p>
        <p>The Lumpa church was outlawed on 3 August 1964 and Lenshina surrendered to the police just after a few days. In 1970, the grand church building was erased to rubble by the government. Lenshina died while under house arrest in Chilenje on 7 December 1978.</p>
        <p>Though Lenshina and her followers were only armed with spears, axes and pangas, it took a considerable time to bring the movement to its knees. This was a source of worry to the government in case a more organised and armed rebel movement emerged. There was undoubtedly an urgent need of devising strategies that would ensure the swift movements of a well-trained and armed military Unit in bringing to a complete halt any insurrection as soon as it started.</p>
        <p>Taking lessons from the Lumpa uprising, Major Dowling strongly advocated for the formation of a special force team that would be trained in thwarting any such uprisings in the future. That meant the group's organisation, movements, techniques and skills were to be different from the regular Units. Thus, the ''Dog Force'' was established on 30 November 1965. The hastily assembled group was trained in both Limited and Counter Insurgency Warfare.</p>
        <p>The Special Force Team's primary objective was to deter Lenshina's followers who were squatting in Congo (Mokambo) from making their way into the country through Mufulira town which shares a borderline with Congo. There were concerns that her followers might reorganise to fight back the government. The team conducted Cordon and Search as well as Road Block Operations to curtail any plans from Lenshina's followers in making any surprise comeback. Thus, it conducted its first operations in Mufulira codenamed ''Stallion''.</p>
        <p>After the incarceration of Lenshina, the Special Force Team (Dog Force) was in 1967 disbanded. However, there was a screaming need by 1976 to recreate a similar force that would protect the country from a looming civil war being perpetuated against the Zambian legitimate government by the Mushala armed rebellion.</p>

    <div class="chapter">
        <h2>CHAPTER TWO: THE MUSHALA REBELLION</h2>
        <p>Mushala's armed rebellion had by 1976, a year after publicly taking up arms against the legitimate government instilled fear and uncertainty to those wielding the instruments of power as well as the local citizenry. The name Mushala evoked a wide rage of images and induced fear in the minds of Zambians in general and locals of North-Western Province in particular. Mushala's presence and invisibility haunted the country from 1976 to 1982.</p>
        <p>The government viewed Mushala as Public Enemy Number One agitating a political insurgency through military rebellion. He notorious dissenter commanding an outlawed gangster that terrorised the locals of North-Western Province. The government further described Mushala as a disgruntled citizen who was seeking for sympathy from the Zambian populous by way of masking himself as the ''Zambian Robin Hood'' who fought against the government for the needs of the poor. The government accused him of being a traitor who sought to tarnish the reputation of the country before the International Community. Dead or alive, he had to be brought down to his knees for the safety of the nation.</p>
        <p>However, the general view of the local population was different. The locals viewed Mushala as a militant freedom fighter who played a significant part in the independence of the country but was sidelined from a befitting political appointment due to his ethnic extraction. They viewed him as a hero who stood against the One-Party Political System and spoke out against the ills of the government's administration. He was the ''Lion of the Lunga'' who faced the authoritative leadership of Dr Kenneth Kaunda. Some locals therefore, felt obligated in supporting his cause.</p>
        <p>Therefore, Individual description of Mushala varied according ones' political affiliation, geographical location and ethnicity among others.</p>
        <p>Adamson Bratson Musanda Mushala was among the United National Independence Party (UNIP) members who put their lives on the line in fighting the Colonial Administration. He was sent to China where he learnt basics of guerilla warfare with the view of imparting his knowledge and play a lead role in fighting against the colonial masters.</p>
        <p>However, due to some disputes with President Kenneth Kaunda, Mushala ditched UNIP for the United Party (UP) founded by Mufaya Mumbuna, once MP for Mazabuka. The UP grew in strength and numbers under the popular leadership of Nalumino Mundia who had also abandoned the ruling party and took leadership of the UP from its founder.</p>
        <p>Mushala held a role of Deputy National Secretary. When UP was banned by the government, it merged with the African National Congress (ANC) and Mushala became ANC Provincial Chairman for North Western Province. The position won him the support of the local population and his ambitions in leadership increased.</p>
        <p>Out of frustration arising from the Choma declaration of 1972 that banned all political parties and introduced a One-Party Participatory Democracy, Mushala began to make military manoeuvres with the aim of coming up with a political and military movement that would unseat Dr Kenneth Kaunda. Mushala argued that since Kaunda did not want to be removed from the Office of the Presidency using the legitimate power of the ballot, he was left with no option but to forcefully remove him from the office using the power of the barrel.</p>
        <p>He justified his position of taking up arms against the government as the only response to the imposed ban on multi-party democracy. He believed the DSC was the only option for Zambians in getting rid of UNIP as all political parties that needed to make checks and balances for the government had been outlawed.</p>
        <p>Mushala's movement took after the independence political parties of the time which both had a political and military wing fighting for an ideology worthy dying for or beliefs shared by the majority who were cowards to voice out their concerns. His movement was called Democratic Supreme Council (DSC) which Sayimbwende later changed to Democratic Revolution Movement (DEREMO) when he took over from Mushala.</p>
        <p>There might have been many reasons that led to Adamson Mushala in taking up arms against the government of the day. One of the reasons was Mushala's refusal to bow down to ethnic politics or nepotism. Mushala accused the UNIP Government of playing politics of tribalism in the allocation of natural resources as well as political appointments. He argued that Kaunda gave appointments to those hailing from Northern, Luapula and Eastern provinces while side-lining independence freedom fighters from other provinces including North Western Province.</p>
        <p>Mushala qualified his argument as having been the reason on why he had not been given a senior political appointment even after winning over the support of the North Westerners to the government. The outright refusal of the president in handing Mushala his request led to a fall out that put the country on the edge of insecurity for a period spanning more than six years.</p>
        <p>Mushala claimed the cementing of the national motto of ''One Zambia One Nation'' could not have been realised if other political players in respective provinces did not persuade the locals in aligning themselves to the newly formed government.</p>
        <p>Throughout his armed struggle, Mushala did not campaign for the secession of North Western Province even when some Chiefs in the province were aligning themselves with chiefs from other countries. The political tribalism card that was on a high prevalent rate was once addressed by Dr Kenneth Kaunda at the Mulungushi Conference in 1967. That might have motivated him to fight a moral war of equality and equity among all citizens without regard to one’s ethnic extraction.</p>
        <p>It was thus easy for those that felt marginalised by the UNIP Government to sympathise with Mushala's political and military campaign. Mushala was idolised as their hero and voice. They deemed his fight as one for humanity.</p>
        <p>Taking advantage of the fact that Zambians are traditionally divided along tribal and regional lines, Mushala knit a message of National Unity that would eradicate tribal political appointments and resource allocation.</p>
        <p>Mushala therefore, advocated for a Federal Government where Traditional Chiefs would superintend over the affairs of the provinces. He argued that the Federal governance system would help in identifying the priorities in provinces and promote a balanced distribution of resources.</p>
        <p>Such a campaign earned him support from some of the chiefs who believed their authority was being undermined by the government since the attainment of independence. It is important to note that traditional chiefs were highly used in collection of taxes and conveying of information to natives. However, such a chain of command was disrupted after the attainment of independence as civil servants took over the responsibilities that were once the preserve of the traditional chiefs.</p>
        <p>To win the support of the wealthy, Mushala heavily anchored his campaign on castigating the government's ideology of African Democratic Socialism which was later swapped for ''Humanism'' in 1967. He advocated for capitalism and a liberal market where citizens would be free to acquire property without fear of being interrogated by the government machinery.</p>
        <p>Mushala stood against the Zambianisation of the country by agitating for privatisation of national owned institutions and democratisation of the governance system. He spoke against the deportation of the white minority by campaigning for an all-inclusive society without racial or tribal segregation.</p>
        <p>Following the activities of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) led by Jonas Savimbi of Angola, Mushala was inspired to take arms and lead an insurrection against the UNIP government. His active phase began in 1976 when his armed group started to forcefully recruit the youth in his organisation. His group that began with 21 men saw an increase to 126 men. Few joined willingly in support of the cause while others were forcefully conscripted into his movement. This gave rise to the increase in cases of abductions, arson and plunder. Women were reportedly abducted and forced into marriage while others were raped and let go.</p>
        <p>His recruitment catchment area was restricted to parts of North Western Province such as Kasempa, Mwinilunga and also to the remote Copperbelt towns such as Chambeshi. His copperbelt camp was pitched at Misenga area. The majority of the recruits were from his ethnic extraction whom he had convinced that the government was treating them as secondary citizens.</p>
        <p>Contrary to many people's beliefs, that Mushala was a leader of a haphazardly assembled rebel group, his military group was well-organised and coordinated. Mushala's movement was far from the general depiction it received as South African-sponsored terrorists.</p>
        <p>Mushala intelligently recruited men into his group, steadily spreading his campaign against the One Party Participatory Democracy. In 1977 Mushala recruited Alex Sayimbwede into his gang from Chambeshi on the Copperbelt. Like many others that were recruited before or after him, he was given a choice of joining the group or die. By 1979, Alex Sayimbwede had asserted his authority and proved his royalty to Mushala. He later took over as as Second In Command of the group from Mushala's young brother Friday Mushala. Alexander Ndandi Mutembo Saimbwede who hailed from Sumbi village of Chief Kanyama was feared as the most inflexible and notorious leader.</p>
        <p>The DSC armed group survived through honey collection, as well as hunting for game and Ivory which they traded with the locals through barter system. At times they assigned some trusted locals to sell their merchandise in towns where they would fetch a high price. The couriers were knowledgeable of the fact that any breach of information about Mushala and his group, to the government authorities was punishable by death. The life of the courier and his family members was closely tied to his ability in keeping a secret.</p>
        <p>To supplement food from their cultivated fields which was not always enough, Mushala's Armed Group plundered the community of food and other basic necessities. Locals out of fear of persecution opened up their bans. Locals also felt obligated in donating their food and give him Intel about the government's troops as a way of showing solidarity and loyalty to the movement.</p>
        <p>Being suspected of siding with the government was a treasonous act only punished by death. Those who were sympathetic to the government or betrayed the trust of the movement were hacked to death. Bullets were scarcely used on traitors as they did not have enough. Ammo was reserved for security wings who were on their backs.</p>
        <p>The movement also received sympathy and support from some foreign governments that had trained and armed the movement with assault rifles, heavy machine guns and grenades. Mushala understood that it was an era of covert diplomacy and destabilisation which were used by surviving colonial powers to create unpalatable condition in countries they wanted to exert their influence.</p>
        <p>Mushala therefore, aligned his movement with the country's regional enemies. He took advantage of the conflicts taking place within the region. Most of the countries were at war with themselves on conflicts sponsored by colonial masters who still had unfinished businesses with countries seeking independence as well as those that had just attained independence. The internal wrangles destabilised the nations, giving an opportunity of colonial masters in advancing their agenda.</p>
        <p>Zambia, having attained her independence prior to her neighbours that among others include Angola, South West Africa (Namibia), Northern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe), Mozambique and South Africa, took the burden of hosting regional liberation movements. Therefore, the only way of halting their military activities was to destabilise Zambia by creating an internal struggle that would take their eyes off from assisting regional military movements.</p>
        <p>Mushala therefore, sought to make relations with South Africa with the view of receiving military assistance. However, Mushala's international relations and diplomacy flopped as his trainers and sponsors failed to fully fund his movement.</p>
        <p>The apartheid government of South Africa cut their relations with Mushala. Jonas Savimbi who was giving the Angolan government sleepless nights backtracked on helping Mushala with ammunition. Such lack of international support crippled his military activities and brought to a halt his cross-border movements that had seen him visit South Africa, South West Africa (Namibia) and Angola.</p>
        <p>Therefore, Adamson Mushala turned to local well-wishers for varying support which he got from allies he had within the circles of the government. Some of the government's top officials and high ranking UNIP officials who were not happy with Dr Kenneth Kaunda's rule secretly supported the movement.</p>
        <p>Government officials that secretly pledged their allegiance to Mushala wrote letters and put them next to Dr Kenneth Kaunda purporting to have been written and delivered by the invisible Mushala. This psychological warfare led to the majority of citizens in believing that Mushala was invisible and omnipresence. Thus, mortal lips were hesitant to speak of his name or report his acts to the police in fear of being heard and punished by the man who could be found in all places at one time. Such a belief demoralised the security wings that were hunting him down. It is practically impossible to fight an invisible enemy.</p>
        <p>The government reacted by sending the paramilitary to bring Mushala's action to a halt. However, Mushala continued eluding the security wings. His advanced guerrilla tactics edged the conventional knowledge that was being used by the police in hunting him down. Mushala was well-acquainted with the province and its terrain and hence chose defensive and attacking positions that gave him advantage over the police that had less knowledge of the terrain as most were recruited from other parts of the country. His guerrilla tactics were also superior to those of the paramilitary who were trained to maintain law and order and if it went to the worst, quenching riots. Therefore, the Paramilitary failed to arrest the situation.</p>
        <p>The failure of the security wings in capturing Mushala led to many in believing that he was using witchcraft and supernatural powers in evading their chase. They believed that he could turn from anything ranging from a bird to a whirlwind. There was also a common belief that bullets of those that aimed at killing him turned into water. Citizens became more scared of myths surrounding him than the man himself. He was believed to have supernatural powers that made him disappear right in the presence of his enemies. To many, hunting down Mushala was an impossible mission.</p>

        <h2>CHAPTER THREE: FORMATION OF THE TASK FORCE</h2>
        <p>Mushala devised a strategy that embodied political, social, economic and psychological intensity on the military and government that was aimed at making the government negotiate terms that would favour him. His continued harassment of locals and the security wings which was accomplished by extremely subtle, flexible tactics were designed to wear out the military as well as make the population raise up against the government. It was a way of arm-twisting the government in making negotiations.</p>
        <p>Mushala's military strategies seemed to be always ahead of the State Security Wings. The attempts of the Security Wings in bringing Mushala down proved futile. This frustrated the Commander In Chief of the Defence Force, Dr Kenneth Kaunda, the President of the Republic of Zambia. It became evident the mission would only be achieved by deploying soldiers that were equally trained in guerrilla warfare to match his tactics.</p>
        <p>The President therefore, directed the Commander of the Zambia National Defence Force (ZNDF), Major General Kingsley Chinkuli to establish a Special Unit that would be sufficiently trained in guerrilla warfare which was being used by Mushala with the aim of halting his military campaign within the shortest possible time. The ZNDF Commander established the Special Combat Force (SCF) that was to train and conduct operations after the manner of Special Forces. The Special Combat Force was later renamed Task Force.</p>
        <p>The timely initiative led to the formation of the Task Force in 1976. They were to undertake an operation known as ''Operation Bandit Nest'' that spanned from 1976 to 1982. The operation was given the name Bandit Nest as it stemmed from Mushala's signal of rebellion by snatching the payroll of Public Works Department (PWD) in Sesheke while en-route to North Western province from South Africa through Namibia. The initial thought was that Mushala was nothing but a bandit hence the Operational codename Bandit Nest.</p>
        <p>The Task Force was formed by choosing young and energetic Officers and Men from all Battalions in the Zambia Army. There was a mixed reaction from among Officers and Men whose names had been selected to compose the Task Force. Like in any other active operation, some soldiers were elated to join the Task Force as they wanted to test their military tactics and knowledge they acquired through training in actual combat.</p>
        <p>They were eager to put to an end the rebellion that had destabilised the region. They had sworn an oath of protecting the territorial integrity of the Republic of Zambia by protecting the Nation against internal and external aggression.</p>
        <p>However, the list was not without men that were scared of being launched in the battlefield. It was difficult to imagine fighting against an ''Invisible Armed Group''. The police had already registered a number of casualties. Nonetheless, Zambia Army being a Force and not Volunteering Service had no space for cowards who might have wished to have their names withdrawn.</p>
        <p>The soldiers that were selected to constitute the Task Force were assembled at Kohima Barracks in Kabwe for training. The Task Force Commander was Second Lieutenant Joseph Chuula Matimba (late Colonel Matimba) and his Batman was Private Nyambe HD who later became the third Regimental Sergeant Major (RSM) for 1 Commando Unit from 1998 to.... Lieutenant JM Matimba had a large towering figure with a loud voice that easily echoed to the four corners of the Parade Square when addressing his men. His intimidating figure was enough to instil confidence in the troops. He was feared as he was respected and revered.</p>
        <p>Lieutenant Colonel Lubasi from the Third Infantry commander for the group given that the Task Force Fighting Battalion was called in as the administrative Commander had a very junior rank which limited his making daily decisions and implementing policies. For six powers in a sensitive operation that called for brevity in months, they were trained and grilled by local instructors in guerrilla tactics and insurgent warfare. The Task Force was a Company strength.</p>
        <p>They were trained in irregular warfare that avoided large engagements. The Task Force was of limited numbers to scale combat and focussing on small, stealthy, hit-and-run make it effective in scouting as well as conducting raids and Mushala's bases and the DSC AG respectively. They were also armed with the skills and knowledge of cutting the DSC AG's food and ammunition supply. ambushes on</p>
        <p>The lessons were aimed at imparting the soldiers with patience. Fighting an insurgent as Mushala required calm and patience that are very vital in laying a successful ambush. The battle would never be won in a day, week, month or even a year. The DSC AG operated without a fixed defensive position. They were mobile. This meant that victory could only be ascertained by eroding and exhausting the enemy's strength. Tactically, they had to push the rebel group away from human habitation where they possibly could have the advantage of using human shield to far flung places where they would lack basic needs, including water, medical supplies and shelter.</p>
          <p>They were also taught on mastering the art of stealthy infiltration behind enemy lines as opposed to using aggression in dismantling the enemy. Their sixth sense needed to be at the very best. Some of the guerilla fighters lived as informers within the community. This means that they had to treat everyone as a suspect without showing it out.</p>
          <p>After a gruesome six months training, the Task Force was launched in their first ever operation as an entity. The eyes of the Nation and Region was on the Task Force. They were received as heroes in North Western Province. The hearts and minds of the locals were once more won to the government. The presence of the Task Force assured the locals of protection and restoration of law and order.</p>
          <p>However, there were also fears of the reaction from the DSC AG. They were afraid that Adamson Mushala would attack the locals to show that he was still in command of the province and was not intimidated by the Task Force. Nonetheless, in their silent whispers, they wished for Mushala to melt away from the young energetic soldiers that had taken over Solwezi, Mwinilunga, Kasempa and other towns where he had left a trail of destruction and fear. The objective of the Task Force was well spelt out. By all means necessary, the Task Force were to bring down Mushala and put an immediate end to his insurrection. They had a duty of not only restoring law and order in North Western Province but to win the support of the local population. It was clear that the local population were supporting Mushala either out of sympathy or fear. The Task Force had a clear objective of winning back their trust to the government.</p>
          <p>It was also the duty of the Task Force to protect the local population from the violent acts of Mushala as well as protecting the youth from conscription into his militia. This entailed that the duty of the Task Force was not only to hunt down Mushala but provide a twenty-four seven security system in protecting the local population from his brutality.</p>
          <p>The Task Force first deployed at Kangwena just by the outskirts of Solwezi before establishing a Patrol Base near Mutanda River at Solwezi-Mutanda junction that connects to Kasempa and Mwinilunga. From the established headquarters, they sent out Sections for patrols. The patrols would go as far as Kakoma near the border.</p>
          <p>Following the establishment of the headquarters and strategical deployment of the Task Force in 1977, Command at Zambia Army Headquarters called for Second Lieutenant Matimba and promoted him to full Lieutenant. A year later in 1978, he rose to the rank of a Captain. The upgrade in rank gave him an increased leverage in the use of his powers as Task Force Commander.</p>
          <p>Some Sections were deployed in strategic positions to protect High Value Targets that were on Mushala's Kill List. They provided the targets with twenty-four-hour protection from Mushala's wrath. Among those earmarked to be brutally killed by Mushala were Chief Chizela of Mufumbwe and Mr Katambi in Katambi village in Mwinilunga. The former was known to have stood against the ideals of the movement while the latter was seen as a threat to the movement due to his perceived connection to the government. Mr Katambi had a son in the Army working under the Intelligence Office and hence the movement felt most of the Intel on the whereabouts of his men was given to the soldiers on the ground by Mr Katambi's son.</p>
          <p>The Task Force had a mountain to climb in halting the DSC AG. Despite conducting day and night patrols, Mushala continued to elude the Task Force. Mushala's continued elusiveness revealed the gap that existed between the DSC AG and the Task Force. One of the reason was due to Mushala's advanced Guerrilla tactics. Though the Task Force had been taught in Guerrilla Warfare, it was the DSC AG and the Task Force. One of the reasons was first time that they would apply the knowledge in the field. The time spent in training was short in comparison to the experience that DSC AG members had mastered while on the ground. This meant, he was always steps ahead.</p>
          <p>Mushala's Armed Group was well advanced in ambushes, sabotage, raids, petty warfare, hit and run tactics and mobility which he rightly employed in inflicting maximum casualties to a less-mobile traditional military that prided itself in having larger numbers in its file and ranks.</p>
          <p>Mushala who was a native of North Western province understood the terrain better than soldiers some of whom it was the first time to be deployed in the province. Mushala selected places that would give him advantage of the military in setting up his bases.</p>
          <p>The other reason was the fact that he had won the support of the locals either out of sympathy or fear. No one dared to give out his position. It is generally believed that some locals would hide Mushala in their homes and yet confessed to the military of never having seen him or any member of the DSC AG in their lives. They were threatened of being killed if they ever gave the government troops any information about him. The whole household of a traitor would be hacked to death and the huts given to the wrath of flames. ''Twenakumumvwatu, ketwamumonane'', ''we have only heard of him, but have never seen him'' was the chorus given to troops asking the whereabouts of Mushala.</p>
          <p>There was also a high probability of high ranking UNIP officials aiding Mushala in evading government forces. The ban of opposition political parties and the introduction of One Party Participatory Democracy meant that politicians who harboured ideas of getting the presidency could only do so by way of helping Mushala ousting Dr Kenneth Kaunda from presidency by use of force.</p>
          <p>The huge numbers of the Task Force made it difficult to chase down a movement that operated in very few numbers. It was easy for members of the DSC AG to easily melt away before the Task Force, and fuse themselves within other community members. They were a part of the community they operated in and hence difficult to identify them as militias. It was also a near impossible thought of the family to give up its members that had joined the movement.</p>
          <p>Mushala also took advantage of the ITT Supersonic radios that gave him a unique sound when Army personnel were transmitting using their radios. This strategy was an early warning to Mushala of the proximity of the Task Force. The Armed Group then relocated to some other places, It took a lot of time for the Task Force to know the strategy that was being used by Mushala in monitoring their locations.</p>
          <p>Knowing that they were outnumbered, the DSC AG would just fire few shots and take off into the bush or nearby villages. There were moments when they would deliberately fire shots to draw the Task Force to a particular into that direction while relocating to a new place using the area with the aim of either ambushing them or sending them where Mushala would make noise in a certain direction and opposite direction. This was known as ''Buffalo Tactics'' then attack in the opposite direction.</p>
          <p>Mushala was also good at ant-tracking tactics. Those that followed his trails and that of the soldiers did so in vain After a few kilometres the soldiers would move in reverse to confuse those that were tracking them. At times they would smartly use branches to clear off the trails. This made it hard for troops to successfully trail the militias. The same ant-tracking tactics were also used by the Mailoni Brothers of Luano Valley in the subsequent years.</p>
          <p>The Task Force came closer to killing Mushala after getting his location from an elderly woman that had been abducted from the village to help Mushala's wife whom he married from Mufumbwe in giving birth. The woman was later given game meat as her payment which attracted Intelligence Officers when they heard of a woman selling game meat. After being questioned, she gave up Mushala's position.</p>
          <p>The Task Force laid an ambush on the route that Mushala was using from cultivating his field. Mushala appeared between 18 and 19 hours heading towards the path that Task Force had laid an ambush. Before he could fully get into the Killing Zone, Mushala sensed the danger and took another route. Though Task Force soldiers saw his face, they did not pull the trigger. It was clear that Mushala's ten lives were beginning to thin out. It was only a matter of time before he was to face his ultimate end. There was also a possibility that having sensed danger for his life, Mushala would melt away from the province or country.</p>
          <p>Mushala immediately abandoned his base. When soldiers swept through the abandoned base, they found Bibles and hymn books most of which were in Lozi. Mushala spent every Sunday in worship. With Sentries around, they sat under trees singing and praying. Mushala had always argued that he was not a murderer who would shed blood for the innocent including the soldiers that were hunting for him day and night. He only attacked civilians to get food and civil servants to scare them from reporting to the government about his locations. He only had scores to settle with the government.</p>
          <p>In 1982, the Task Force was told to prepare to withdraw deployment comes with adverse results such as taking the as they had overstayed in the operation area. Prolonged once emergency operation as routine. Soldiers may also develop familiarity with the locals and may even sympathise with those they are supposed to bring to justice.</p>
          <p>Zambia Army Headquarters therefore, sent the Fourth Infantry Fighting Battalion to relieve the Task Force Command at Zambia Army Headquarters gave the Task Force more time in the operation area to ensure there was a smooth and complete orientation and handover of duties, including Intrep, terrain analysis, skills and knowledge sharing concerning the operation.</p>
          <p>On 26 November 1982, Soldiers from the Fourth Infantry Fighting Battalion laid an ambush and patiently waited for Mushala to return to his camp. Adamson Bratson Musanda Mushala was gunned down, a few metres away from his base.</p>
          <p>The news of Mushala's death was received with excitement and fear. The local population were excited for their freedom and possible return to normalcy to their daily activities. They wanted their children to go back to school without fear of being abducted and their wives to go into the fields for cultivation without fear of being raped or forcefully married to the DSC AG.</p>
          <p>However, others harboured fear of the revenge from the Armed Group. They were scared that the death of Mushala would instigate his followers to take up arms and pour out their anger on the defenceless locals. Still others did not believe that Mushala had really been killed due to the myths that surrounded him.</p>
          <p>To dispel rumours that Mushala was an invisible being that could not be killed, his body was displayed at Solwezi hospital. The mission once dubbed ''Impossible'' by many. had come to an end. Alex Sayimbwende took over the DSC and changed it to DEREMO. It never proved any threat to the government or the community. They were largely in the bush not for revenge of their leader but for fear of being arrested or killed by the authorities.</p>

      <div class="chapter">
          <h2>CHAPTER FOUR: FORMATION OF 1 COMMANDO UNIT</h2>
          <p>The Mission of the Task Force came to an end with the remains the longest operation that a Unit has been deployed gunning down of Mushala. Operation Bandit Nest still without any rotations. Therefore, the Task Force was their respective Units and Formations where they were disbanded and the Officers and Men were taken back to six years of deployment in an intense operation. It was the lessons learned from the Mushala Rebellion that birthed the thought of having a Standing Force that would immediately quench such an insurrection in the future. The restored peace in the province could not be taken for granted.</p>
          <p>The need to establish a Commando Unit in Zambia Army was a screamer that could not be delayed any further. Commandos’ world over are trained in both convention and unconventional warfare. Unlike Regular Units and Formations that are trained to fight in large numbers, Commandos are trained to fight in small entities that gives them an advantage in conducting Special Operations and Missions with less margin of error. Commandos operate as an invisible force whose presence is only announced by the effects of the results left in the battlefield. They play a crucial role in asymmetric warfare and in mission support or tactical enabling operations.</p>
          <p>They are trained to fight behind enemy lines and conduct operations ranging from special reconnaissance, direct action, collecting of information in enemy territory. ambushes, airbone operations, psychological operations, hostage rescue to raids, covert operations,</p>
          <p>In the same period of the Mushala Rebellion, Zambia Army was already outstretched with a lot of operations and skirmishes from the South African Defence Forces (SADF) who from time to time launched their attacks in Zambia through the South West Africa (Namibia) border during their fights with the People’s Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN) and the South West African People’s Organisation (SWAPO). Zambia Army was also fighting wars launched into the country by soldiers from Southern Rhodesia who struck many parts of the country in trying to fight against Joshua Nkomo’s movement, the Zimbabwe African People’s Union (ZAPU) and its military wing Zimbabwe People’s Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA). The instability in North Western Province border created by the Angolan war been waged by Jonas Savimbi’s National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) against colonial rule could not be ignored. It was the same case with Independence of Angola (UNITA) against the Portuguese eastern province whose security was threatened with the Liberation Front of Mozambique (FRELIMO) and the Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO).</p>
          <p>There was therefore, a sense of urgency in establishing a were being fought from the Zambian territory as well as Special Forces Unit to help deal with foreign battles that curbing out any internal insurrection. It meant that the group had to be trained in both conventional and non-conventional welfare.</p>
          <p>In preparation of establishing a Special Force Unit, the Government of the Republic of Zambia through Military Exchange Programs invited Korean Special Forces to train selected Zambian soldiers in Commando training. The Zambia Army prioritised Officers and Men that had constituted the Task Force.</p>
          <p>Members of the Task Force had already undergone intense training in unconventional warfare prior to the deployment in North Western Province. Operation Bandit Nest had armed the Task Forces members with immense experience on guerrilla warfare. The knowledge and experience gathered would be of great help to most of commando candidates who had been selected for training in anticipation of quenching such insurrections in the future.</p>
          <p>Command also thought it wise to include all the Task Force members for Commando training because most of the soldiers had difficulties in settling back in their Units and Formations. The operation of hunting down Mushala had left a long-lasting effect in their minds. Therefore, there was need to reunite the group in order to keep them sane and active. Thus, members of the disbanded Task Force were a priority in Commando Recruitment.</p>
          <p>Some of the Task Force members that went on to become Commandos include late WOI Libingi (second RSM for 1 Commando Unit), WOI H Nyambe (3rd RSM for 1 Commando Unit), WOII Mulinda (late), Sgt Muchu (late), WOII Kalonga, WOI Kalinda (late), WOI Timothy Kabilika (late) Sikalonga, George Mudenda, Kapwaya, Milupi and Pumulo.</p>
          <p>Members of the belted Task Force were taken to MILTEZ and trained by Korean Instructors in leadership to help prepare them take up command appointments during Commando training. The large number of young soldiers needed seasoned Section Commanders, Platoon Sergeants, Company Quarter Master Sergeants and Company Sergeant Majors. They became a Commando Command Post.</p>
          <p>The Army also picked energetic young officers and soldiers from all battalions that fell within the age group of twenty and twenty-five years. Due to the hazardous nature of training, they were to be subjected to, no female was picked. Like during the formation of the first Task force, some soldiers did not want to go for commando training due to the gruesome training that they had anticipated would be ‘inhumane’.</p>
          <p>Prior to the general recruitment of regular soldiers into Special Forces Candidates, a group consisting of 10 Officers and trained under the Korean tutelage as Candidates for and 30 Soldiers was specially selected from different Units Commando Instructors. Stationed at Zecco Lilanda Training Camp in Lusaka, the group was trained in Unarmed Combat.</p>
          <p>The aim of training them into a killing art known as Martial Arts that would ultimately enable them help the kyugsu was to equip them with skills and knowledge of Korean Instructors in training the main body during Commando Basic Training. Simply put, it was a Martial Arts Instructors' Course.</p>
          <p>The group that was led by Lieutenant Kasongo included among others WOI Chabala and WOI Kabamba. The pass-out was officiated by Dr Kenneth Kaunda. The Army Commander was Lt Gen Malimba Masheke and the Deputy Army Commander was Maj Gen Christone Tembo.</p>
          <p>The death of Lcpl Mundia who passed on during training induced a lot of fear for those on the list of Commando training. If it were that rough for instructors, then it would be worse for Commando trainees. However, the Army refused to pocket any excuse from Officers and Men who wanted to dodge the commando training.</p>
          <p>After the graduation of Martial Arts Instructors that had been trained from Zecco Lilanda Camp and former Task Force members that had undergone leadership training in MILTEZ both groups left for Katete, Eastern Province. This was the first group to be moved to Katete before other Commando candidates. The Proposed Instructors were subjected to a test on who would make the final list as Instructors to assist Koreans. Out of thirty Martial Arts Candidate Instructors, only eight were picked. Among the eight were WOI Chabala, Sibuyu (late), Chitamba (late) and Kunda.</p>
          <p>Intake 19 which was also training at Zambia National Service Recruit Training Centre in Ndola (now Ingwe Barracks) were conscripted for Commando training. They were young, energetic and ambitious without any fears or concerns as haboured by ''old soldiers''. Some of the notables in this intake who later played a pivotal role in shaping Commando Unit are WOI Lumwayo.</p>
          <p>All Officers and Men whose names appeared on the list converged at 2ZR. Due to the large number of Commando Candidates (a thousand plus), some did their medicals from 2ZR while others conducted medical checkups from Maina Soko Military Hospital. This was the only time when a soldier who had been declared unfit to train as a commando could be dropped from the list.</p>
          <p>Medical tests were thorough to ensure less loss of lives during the training. All those that were medically unfit for commando training were told to report back to their Units and Formations. It is important to note that due to the fact that most of the candidates were still very young and energetic, only a few numbers were declared not fit to undertake Commando training.</p>
          <p>The group that passed the medicals were transported in Infa trucks to Chiwoko training Camp in Eastern Province under tight Military Escort by the Military Police. Chiwoko Military Training Camp was under the Zambia National Service.</p>
          <p>For the first time ever, Commando training started in 1983 at Chiwoko training camp in Katete. The Commanding Officer for Commando Trainees at Chiwoko was Lt Col Mark Mulyokela Waluka from Engineer Squadron in Mufulira. Captain Matimba was Platoon Commander. The Regimental Sergeant Major was WOII Monde who was called from the Fifth Infantry Fighting Battalion. He took over from Ssgt Libingi who initially was standing in as RSM.</p>
          <p>Some of the members of the Task Force who took various command roles such as platoon and section Commanders include Sikalonga, Mulinda, George Mudenda, Kapwaya, Milupi and Pumulo.</p>
          <p>The group was divided into four companies, Alpha commanded by Captain Ezron Mwila (also OC Training) -CSM was Ssgt Mudenda, Bravo Coy was under Captain Michelo (Goligoli) from 64 Armored Reg while Cpl H Nyambe was Platoon Sergeant, Charlie Coy was under Captain Chiyabi, CSM was Ssgt Kalonga, Support Coy was commanded by Captain Musalu, CSM was Mulinda. The Commanding Officer was Lt Col Waluka from 1 Engineer Regiment and the Battalion Second in Command was Major Matimba. The Adjutant was Captain Makoyi and the training officer was Captain Luyi.</p>
          <p>Training was divided into four categories in respective to training companies, Skill At Arms, Demolition, Tactics- Guerilla warfare and navigation, and Unarmed Combat. Companies would then rotate. The training was almost nine months. The Instructors from ZECCO were with their companies and only supervised or assisted when their company was doing Martial Arts.</p>
          <p>It is important to understand that all the trainings were conducted by Korean Instructors who taught with the help of interpreters. This required maximum concentration. This posed a challenge to the learners. Instructors had to emphasise some points so that learners would understand.</p>
          <p>The training was hard and realistic as expected. Though Zambia Army needed a large number of military personnel to adorn the Special Forces uniform, training was not compromised to accommodate everyone to graduate. Commando in every Army is the preserve of the few brave, fearless and selfless combatants who every second of their lives are ready to yield their lives for the mission. Despite having the above values, one must be able to make quick decisions within seconds and implement the needed actions.</p>
          <p>They were trained in conventional and unconventional warfare, pseudo operations, survival, orienteering, silent killing, signalling, amphibious and cliff assault, handling of different weapons, demolition skills, close-quarter combat (Martial Arts - Gyksu) and physical fitness.</p>
          <p>As the motto for commando training. ''From the Rest comes the Best'', not everyone managed to go through all the phases of training. Others crumbled during training and were taken back to their Units. Reasons varied from prolonged sickness, long lasting injuries, malingering, indiscipline, cowardice to negative report from the Instructors and Command.</p>
          <p>There was a monthly program that was known as ''separating cheese from cream'' where trainees were paraded and names of those that had failed to adapt and meet the monthly set standards were called out with trucks to take them back to their Units waiting. Major Matimba would announce those that had been identified as malingerers, sicklers and the indisciplined. As numbers reduced, quality increased.</p>
          <p>After a gruesome training, those that were deemed fit and worthy to undertake Commando duties were paraded on 9th November 1984 at Chiwoko Parade Square for the first passout of Commando trainees. From the 1,600 Commando trainees, only 800 plus graduated as others fell off during training. The long awaited historical passout was attended by the first Republican President of Zambia, Dr Kenneth Kaunda and Zimbabwe's Defence minister. The president was accompanied by all the Service Chiefs, Ministers and other dignitaries especially given the fact that it was the first time the country was graduating Commandos.</p>
          <p>The Commander In Chief of the Defence Force was entertained by demonstrations in tactics, skill at arms, demolition and unarmed combat. The demonstrations were conducted immediately after the passout parade. However, the first proposal was for the Commando trainees to conduct demonstrations and later passout parade but the idea was found to be unworkable. One of the reasons was that energy levels would drop after the demonstrations. To keep the sacredness of the parade, it was therefore settled on having the passout parade prior to demonstrations.</p>
          <p>The President of Zambia promoted all the Commando Trainees to their respective next ranks. Dr Kenneth Kaunda made a pronouncement that has remained the preserve of the Commandos by announcing that ''there will never be a private commando soldier''. Since then, all Commando recruits are promoted to the rank of Lance Corporal on the passout parade. This is in recognition of the gruesome training as well as challenging tasks waiting ahead.</p>
          <p>The Commandos graduated with Camouflaged caps since the Maroon Berets, belts and daggers came late.</p>
          <p>After passout the Koreans left, Zambia Army Instructors from MILTEZ went to help orient the Zambian Commandos on the Zambia Army Training Doctrine so as to align their tactics with the doctrine of Zambia Army. The refresher course ran for a few weeks. Among courses covered were Section and Platoon Battle Drills as the koreans had concentrated on guerilla warfare. There was a need of getting back to limited warfare and thereafter come up with better commando tactics that would be applied in a given mission.</p>
          <p>The commandos remained in Katete four more months after the passout whilst Command was still reconnoitring for the best location.</p>

          <h2>CHAPTER FIVE: ESTABLISHING THE BASE</h2>
          <p>It was during the Indaba which was held under a big tree behind the dining hall at Chiwoko Training Area where the vision of the Unit was outlined. Command allowed soldiers (Warrant Officers and SNCOs) to participate in coming up with the name of the Unit, motto, Unit Tag Number and the Unit Colours.</p>
          <p>Architectures such as Ssgt Mwanza nicknamed vimbombo was among the trainees incorporated in designing the Unit Badge. The genius of the artists was applauded by Command and fellow trainees after designing the present badge that has an eagle carrying a double edged dagger piercing through a leopard. Beneath is the motto fear not death but defeat. Firstly it read ''Fear No Death but Defeat'' but was changed to ''Fear Not Death but Defeat''.</p>
          <p>The dagger was meant for the silence killing of enemy sentries during special operations that require high level secrecy. This includes taking out lookout sentries during raids or infiltrating behind enemy lines. The dagger would be hand held in slicing open the throat of an enemy or throwing it accurately for it to pierce through his heart, throat or the temple. Every Commando was well trained in dagger/knife throwing.</p>
          <p>Tag Number 48 was gotten from the Circuit that trainees had to complete every Friday afternoon. The Camp had a 28KM Circuit on the North and a 20KM Circuit on the South. Trainees therefore called it as the 48 Ring. They were required every Friday afternoon to go through the 28 or and 20 kilometres circuit. Soldiers were always on the 48 Circuit either as a physical fitness exercise or punishment. When requested to give a Tag Number, all the trainees shouted ''48''.</p>
          <p>48 has remained a symbol of endurance, and reinforces the spirit of Commandos to never give up in any situation. Every Commando is known to have ''48 stances'' emanating from the change of stances in a given exercise or operation. Instead of giving up on the mission, they only change stances - flexible to the dictates of the mission.</p>
          <p>The initial name for the Unit was 1st Commando Unit to denote that it was the first Unit of all the other Commando Units that were to be established later. That suggested that there would be 2nd Commando Unit, 3rd Commando Unit until the required number of Commando Units were to be achieved. However, it was changed to 1 Commando Unit. The change was meant to align the Units nomenclature to that of other Regiments that only had a single digit such as 1 Zambian Regiment (1ZR). Some of the Commando T-Shirts and Commando vests still carried 1st Commando Unit until 2005 when new Commando T-Shirts were printed out.</p>
          <p>Other Units that were to be established were Paratrooping Regiment, Marine Unit, Reconnaissance Regiment and Commando Training School. According to the pioneers, all these were to be Independent Special Forces Battalions falling under the single leadership of the Special Forces Commander.</p>
          <p>The Maroons were given to Commandos in early 1986. In between the Commandos were using the caps. Zambian Commandos chose the maroon colour because the green colour was already being used by the Infantry, black by the gunners. The best choice was the camouflaged beret which unfortunately was being used by ZNS.</p>
          <p>From the film ''the eagle has landed'' and other war books, commandos settled for maroon. Initially, maroon staple belts were given instead of the waist belts. The badges with a leopard could not go through hence using infantry badges on the belts.</p>
          <p>An exclusive meeting was called to determine where the first Commando Unit would be established. The guideline was to have the Commandos stationed in a Barrack that was located near rail, road and air services. Officers and Soldiers were given the opportunity of choosing the location of their new Unit.</p>
          <p>The prominent three places chosen were Kafue Gorge, Zambia National Service Camp (Kabwe) and Zambia National Service Camp (Ndola-Mushili). After taking into consideration of all the other tactical and strategic reasons, Commandos settled for the latter. Mushili's proximity to the airport and rail line was a plus for faster movement.</p>
          <p>In March 1985, the advance Party moved to Mushili Barracks while the main body remained in Katete. The delay for the whole Unit to pull out was meant to facilitate ZNS personnel that were still occupying the houses, have enough time to relocate. Between April and August 1985 Commandos pulled out from Katete, Eastern Province and established their base at Mushili Barracks. The newly inducted Commandos were moved to the Zambia National Service Camp in Ndola (Ingwe Barracks).</p>
          <p>The Commandos occupied a two story-building with four large un-demarcated halls meant for single soldiers. The remaining Zambia National Service personnel were given a sudden warning order to vacate their houses in ''One Line'', *Fear Devil'' and ''Kawama'' compounds. Kawama compound was later renamed Waluka Compound in honour of Colonel Mark Mulyokela Waluka the first Commanding Officer for 1 Commando Unit.</p>
          <p>Once ZNS personnel that had remained to provide security to the barracks also pulled out, married Commandos were given time to bring their families and they occupied the few houses available. Therefore, 1 Commando Unit Base, later renamed as Ingwe Barracks was established in 1985.</p>
          <p>The few structures that were dormitories for ZNS trainees were occupied by commandos according to companies. The blocks were meant to be occupied by school leavers that came to undergo military training after completing their high school education with only a couple of Administration Blocks.</p>
          <p>The fact that the place was now to be occupied by a full-fledged battalion meant infrastructure would be a challenge to accommodate all the officers and men.</p>
          <p>In the present Commando Shooting Range once stood buildings that were occupied as offices for ZNS Administrators. However, they started crumbling and officers vacated the buildings which were later demolished. The middle of the sleeping blocks which demarcated the western and eastern wings were turned into offices for Officer Commanding. Up to now, there are no company offices for Officers Commanding apart from the improvised ones that are in-between the sleeping quarters.</p>
          <p>The plan of Commando layout was to have the Battalion Headquarters and Company Offices on the western side of where presently Elite Compound is situated. The stream that passes behind Elite Compound was to be channelled to a dam to be dug a few metres from the stream. On either side of the dam were to be three company offices for Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Engineer and Support Companies. On the centre would be the offices for the Battalion Headquarters.</p>
          <p>The dam was to be used as a training area for swimming, diving and other marine operations such as kayaking and anti-piracy drills.</p>
          <p>The present Zambia Compound which sits just two kilometres from Commando Headquarters and has since been encroached was earmarked to be an airport for Commandos. It was evident from its inceptions and roles that Commandos had to be ready to move at very short notice, hence the need of having an airport.</p>
          <p>The only compound in existence was the One Line and Fear Devil. In Waluka compound there were only two lines of houses that were separated by a road from WOs and Sgts Mess. This meant soldiers had to use initiative if they wanted to leave the blocks and start staying in married quarters. Therefore, soldiers started moulding blocks and built their own houses.</p>
          <p>Aside accommodation crises were the shortage of specialised manpower needed to efficiently and effectively undertake any task or mission. Though most of the commandos were battle tested through the clashes of white minority regimes that were waging wars with Nationalists Movements domiciled in Zambia, they still lacked speciality training that is a must for a Commando to be an all-rounder. Many had not attended military courses as they had been deployed in respective operations to safeguard the country against internal and external aggression.</p>
          <p>Therefore, soldiers were assembled and each asked on the trade to determine the deployment of personnel. Those that were not traded were incorporated in various companies where respective cadres to orient them were conducted.</p>
          <p>Five fighting companies or Sub Units were formed; Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta and Support Companies. The Companies immediately started their specialisation training with Alpha Company in Combat Engineering. Alpha Company did their Engineering course from School of Military Engineering (SME) in Mufulira. Bravo Company specialized in combat driving. They did their course from 1 Commando Unit and in Kalewa. Charlie Company was assigned a Signals course while Delta Company did diving and swimming which they were taught by Zambia Police Instructors in Siavonga.</p>
          <p>Upon completion of Combat Engineering Course in August 1985, Engineering Squadron was formed with 15 soldiers who were detached from Alpha Company after having excelled during their course in Mufulira. One of those was Ret WOI Joseph Daka who later became Combat Engineering Instructor and 48 Marine Unit Project Officer Battery squadron was also formed from those who did signals in artillery leading to an additional of two Sub Units which meant the Battalion had progressed from five to seven Sub Units.</p>
          <p>From inception, Commandos performed well in their military courses because of the strategy that was wisely executed from one commander to another. Those earmarked to go for military courses either locally or abroad were trained on the subject matter before-hand to ensure they do not have difficulties in assimilating the lessons once in school.</p>
          <p>It is from this policy that no Commando was allowed to fail any military course. Any failure would not be taken kindly as it would dent the image of the Unit. Failure is not anywhere near to being an option to a Commando who should lead exemplary from the front.</p>

          <h2>CHAPTER SIX: SPECIALISED LOCAL TRAININGS</h2>
          <p>Following the successful commando basic training that initiated the establishment of the first commando unit in the country, there was need for advanced and specialised training. Specialised training is important as it builds individual capability, teamwork and Unit cohesion. It helps to bring out the natural talents and gifts of individual soldiers which are further harnessed into a field that would require the use of the discovered talent or gift. Team cohesion is crucial in achieving success in all assigned tasks and missions.</p>
          <p>Specialised training puts more emphasis on personal leadership by honing skills that are required when called upon to make a decision in haste. A commando is expected to think ten times faster than anybody else and execute the decision made precisely without any doubt in the mind.</p>
          <p>Without any sign of cowardice, a commando is supposed to stand by his decision and take responsibility.</p>
          <p>Given the fact that commandos do not operate as solo soldiers but in buddy systems and teams, specialised training further helps them to be better team players who will never leave their buddy stuck in the line of fire. With the inculcation of the spirit of selfless service, they are taught how to sacrifice for their buddy and the mission.</p>
          <p>The trainings in Mbala were therefore, important for cohesion of the Unit. Trainings provided an opportunity for all Commandos to possess speciality qualities that would be handy in the success of diverse operations and missions. Trainings opened avenues that allowed individual trainees to realise their talents which were harnessed towards achieving maximum success by being rightly deployed in a sector that would use such talents.</p>
          <p>Mbala trainings were also important in helping all Unit members to be moving at the same level. The Unit had no time to conduct months of rehearsals when given a task as tasks and assignments came at the very time they needed to be executed. Therefore, the Unit had to be ready to be deployed for any mission at the quickest possible time. To successfully undertake such tasks, skills and knowledge had to be on their fingertips.</p>
          <p>Success of the mission was hinged on the capabilities of personnel tasked to conduct the operations. It was as such important for all Commandos to be knowledgeable at all times of what was required of them, because they would be required to undertake any mission at the shortest possible time without any allowance for rehearsal.</p>
          <p>Commandos achieved desired results in their subsequent deployments because of regular trainings that enhanced espirit de corp. Every man knew what was expected of him at any given time. They also knew the strengths and weaknesses of each other. Every Commando was expected to be a brother's keeper.</p>
          <p>Therefore, all the Commandos left for Mbala in 1985 for advanced training. It is important to note that intake 20 that was undergoing Basic Commando training, the period when the first commando intake was training in Eastern province graduated on 06 January 1985, two months after the graduation of the first intake on 09 November 1984. Therefore, there was a need of ensuring that the two groups bonded.</p>
          <p>The compulsory Mbala training would entail sharing of skills and knowledge which is vital for the cohesion of the Unit. For Commandos whose work is hinged on undertaking high risk operations in which everyone's life and success of the mission sorely lie in the man next, it was important to create trust in the abilities and capabilities of those they would be deployed with, hence the importance of the training. It was imperative that since both groups had completed Commando Basic training, they immediately had to undertake Commando Inter-mediate training as a Unit.</p>
          <p>They camped at Outwards Bounds (now School of Special Forces). Mbala was sighted to be the best Training Area for Commandos because it offered all the challenges that come with ideal terrain for commando training in a single setting. The land is so hilly that at every point one is either ascending or descending. Such terrain is admirable for personal physical fitness.</p>
          <p>The training area also provides water-bodies necessary for seaborne operations. It is flanked by Lake Tanganyika, Kalambo Falls and Lake Chira. The trainees used Lake Chira for swimming lessons. It is without compromise that every commando has to learn how to swim. Those who did not know how to swim (Sinkers) spent the first three days taking swimming lessons on the edge of the lake. Theory lessons are quickly followed by practical dry lessons on the land. After mastering the basics, they were dipped into the shallow parts of the lake. That was within a sprint second followed by ''baptising'' the trainees in deeper waters.</p>
          <p>Instructors in their diving suits followed the trainees to the depth or whatever level he reached when going down with the ability of saving anyone showing signs of drowning. Of course, military being not a bible college, the instructors would let the trainee to ''take a few cups'' before giving him a chance to catch some breath. The fear of taking more cups helped sinkers to become divers. The secret with the instructors was in knowing when to extend a helping hand to one who was surely failing.</p>
          <p>Then came ''Ditch and Recovery''. This is an exercise that helped commandos to be under water for not less than ten minutes without coming to the surface. The individual tact to successfully undertake the exercises lay in the ability of one mastering the art of keeping calm in the presence of turmoil. A commando is trained to make decisions using logic and not emotions. He is trained to master his temperament and keep it in check at all time. He is trained never to panic in the face of fear.</p>
          <p>During Ditch and Recovery, the trainee under the close monitoring of the instructors put on various gadgets that he went to drop at the depth of the lake. He dived from the static boat following a rope that rested on the anchor in the sands of the lake. While there was an instructor at the depth of the lake with his oxygen tank, a trainee went without any oxygen tank (cylinder). Before becoming a commando, one had to learn how to be a dolphin, whale or shark.</p>
          <p>Once at the depth of the lake, a trainee removed the weight belt, watch, water glasses and other gadgets from his body. The secret was in having patience so as to be able to control the rate of breathing out. The train would then be required to get back to the surface without damaging the ear drums or the lungs.</p>
          <p>The challenge to many was when shooting back to the surface. Since water is composed of Hydrogen and Oxygen, the trainee needed to clear off the hydrogen from his lungs before shooting to the surface. Failure to undertake the required clearing at the right level led to the bursting of the lungs or damaging of the ear drum. Such was the risk that were faced by the trainees but it was necessary.</p>
          <p>Those that managed to swim a distance of two kilometres as well as the ditch and recovery exercise graduated to tactical swimming. Under tactical swimming trainees were dressed in full combat gear, armed with a personal rifle, binoculars and a radio. While others would be in diving suits, the majority relied on life jackets that helped them float with their personal luggage. They swam from shore to shore while adopting all tactical formations on the way such as the Arrow Head, Diamond and Assault Formations among many others.</p>
          <p>During watermanship lessons, trainees were allowed to cry and scream in calling their ancestors to help them learn how to effortlessly float like a fish. It was not an offence when a trainee was taking a few cups of water and being pulled down by the gravitation force insulted his parents, himself or the instructor. It was a common cry for help. A trainee only reached the last point of pleading for help when he used his local language. One calling out for help in English language was still in his right senses and so could manage to find ways and means of defying the gravitational force.</p>
          <p>Mbala area is also adorned by Sunzu mountains that are very important for mountainous operations. They provide a good area for abseiling and rappelling before they can be done on the aircraft. The mountain runs were tedious and dangerous. Any slip up was potentially leading to the breaking of the bones. In the worst-case scenario, the spinal cord or death. It was during mountain climbs that commandos were taught to be spider men without webs. A commando is expected to cross any obstacle without fail, including climbing the tallest building with any means possible. It is unpardonable sin to report failure to a superior officer when given a mission.</p>
          <p>The Sunzu mountains therefore, provided the surfaces required to teach and learn abseiling and rappelling lessons to the trainees. It made it easier for trainees to quickly master the heliborne drills and operations that included rappelling.</p>
          <p>The Sunzu mountain provided a suspended corridor that was used for obstacle crossing from one mountain to the other using a rope that was anchored on adjacent mountains. Using Commando Crawl, a trainee had to swiftly without attracting any attention cross over to the other mountain. Commando Crawl is useful when crossing from one building to the other when fighting in Built Up Areas without being detected by those guarding the installations.</p>
          <p>Mbala golf course provided a good area for Heliborne operations that among others include static jumps from the helicopter, rappelling and abseiling. The fear of heights pose a threat to many human beings. To break away from the shell of humanity, a trainee had to learn to soar with eagles with or without the parachute depending on the height or the landing surface.</p>
          <p>Given the proximity of the edge of Lake Chira to Mbala Golf Course which is about ten metres, the course offers a good training area for both marine and land warfare. Direct from the boats and Kayaks as well as divers who swam to the shore, trainees adopted fighting formations and attacked Objectives on the land. It brought to reality the art of infiltrating the Commandos behind enemy lines through a water body. The insertion of the Commandos by land, air and water is a concept that has to be understood by all.</p>
          <p>Mbala Golf Course provided such environment where such lessons thrived. The largely undisturbed vast land provided the best area for tactics. Lessons in tactics included SERE, Jungle Warfare, Jungle Lanes, Squad lanes and operations such as Link Up Operations, Patrol Base Operations, Crowd Dispersal, Road Blocks, Ambushes, Raids, Reconnaissance, Maxman ship and Counter Insurgency warfare. It is also conducive for rage exercises where Officers and Men fired their personal weapons (AK47) and Support Weapons.</p>
          <p>Trainees were also introduced to basic demolitions and tactical map reading. Map reading was a must for all the Commandos as their deployment behind enemy lines suggested that they had to be experts in orienting themselves in any environment they find themselves in, without fail. Commandos needed to read the ground and interpret all the features on the ground with those on the map.</p>
          <p>In July 1985, a group of Instructors were sent to Mbala to go and train in Kayaking, Swimming and Mountaineering by the Outward-Bound Lake School, so that the group can later train the rest of the Unit Officers and Soldiers. In September the same year the whole unit moved into Mbala and Camped by Lake Chila.</p>
          <p>Courses covered involved Intermediate training Swimming, Kayaking, and Mountaineering. These were taught by Instructors from then Outward-Bound Lake School in Mbala where there is presently School of Special Forces. The other lessons that among others included Map reading, Tactics, Guerilla, Counter Insurgency and Skill at Arms (SAA) were taught by Commando Instructors. The Unit trained from September 1985 to February 1986.</p>
          <p>Commandos went back to Mbala for advanced training from 1986-87. The six months training was conducted by American soldiers. The training focussed on special operations such as raids and Reconnaissance.</p>
          <p>Following the successful Unit training in Mbala, the whole Unit came went back to Ndola, and a group of Instructors were organized to undertake the first abroad training in Iraq. They went for a Commando gruelling Inter-mediate training for a period of three (3) months.</p>
          <p>In June 1986 fifteen soldiers from A Coy were sent to 1 Engineer Regiment to undergo a Combat Engineer cadre for three (3) months. Upon completing the cadre soldiers contributed money which was saved for the three (03) months and hosted an End of Course Party. This marked the beginning of End of Course Parties at the School of Military Engineering.</p>
          <p>Therefore, Field Engineering Squadron was introduced comprising of the fifteen (15) Engineers who had just reported back from the School of Military Engineering in Mufulira. The the first Squadron Sergeant Major (SSM) was SSGT Simutenda B Who died in 1988 during the 1" Operation Hyena from a Launcher which blasted on his face.</p>
          <p>While Alpha Coy were conducting a cadre in demolitions, Bravo Coy were doing a Driving and Maintenance Cadre and Charlie Coy were doing a Signals cadre, which later formed the first Battery Squadron. The Battery Commander was Captain Chola, the first CSM was Retired WOI S Simalonga.</p>
          <p>At the same time Delta Coy was taken to Chipepo and Siavonga to do further diving lesson with an Instructors from the Zambia Police by the names of Inspector Muyunda and Late Inspector Imusho.</p>
          <p>In January 1988, the Unit moved to Mbala to do a refresher training and trainees for the first time were recruited directly from the civil world to undertake commando training as opposed to internal recruitments. However, the training only lasted for a month as troops were air lifted to Eastern Province, for the first operation, dubbed operation Hyena.</p>
          <p>In 1991, following the pass out of intake 88 and the need of completing the commando courses for the 87s whose trainings were continuously disrupted due to RENAMO activities in Eastern Province, the Unit moved to Mbala for training. The training was modelled a hybrid as it was neither Intermediate nor specialised training. It was meant to bond all the intakes, first commando intake who graduated in 1984, second intake that graduated in 1985, third and first direct to be recruited from the civil world, intake 87s and the intake that had just graduated in 1991 (intake 89). Straight from Mbala, the Unit deployed in Lusaka for Operation Safe Guard. The OC was Major Siame.</p>
          <p>In 1993 Commando underwent their first training operations with the American Rangers, from Fort Bragg, North Carolina in Mbala. This Elite group was specifically chosen to receive training from the Special Forces Green Berets, Operation Detachment 382 from the USA so as to help prepare the Unit for United Nations Peacekeeping Operation in Somalia. In 1993, the group did Basic Commando Training Course with SFODA 386 of the 3rd Special Forces Group (Airborne) conducted from 15 July to 22 August 1993.</p>
          <p>The Americans trained a group of Special Forces into Reconnaissance that had a lot of courses embedded that would help the Unit stand head-to-head with the militias in Somalia. Due to the fact that Reconnaissance was the main course covered, the group that was trained became the first Zambian Special Forces RECONDOS.</p>
          <p>The team was administered by the Battalion Second in Command, Major Mutengo (late). The team was led by Capt Phiri as Team Ldr(OC) deputised by Lt Mangowela as Platoon Commander.</p>
          <p>Among others, the list of Recondos comprised of WOII Simalonga (WOI-Ret as RSM Army Camp), Ssgt Mwenya(late), Cpl Tolani, Sgt Munalula, Sgt Sinjela (late), Lcpl Katungu T, Lcpl Phiri J (died as SSGT), Cpl Mbale R (WOI), Lcpl Chindolo(died as Ssgt in RTA), Cpl Mbewe N (WOI-Ret), Cpl Banda M(WOI-Ret), Lcpl Musumali G(WOI-Ret as first Group Command RSM), Cpl Tolani L(WOI-died as RSM 48 Marine), Lcpl Chungu(WOI-died as RSM Camp), Lcpl Mwikisa(now Lt Col).</p>
          <p>The ones squatting are Cpl Chela, Lcpl Ngulube L, Sgt Daka J (WOI-Ret as Unit Project Warrant Officer 48 Marine, Sgt Munalula S (WOI-Ret as SSM Engineer Squadron) and Cpl Likando S, Banda M, Mulenga E, Mwaba B L.</p>
          <p>The main focus was on special operations that are usually conducted behind enemy lines such as Patrol Base Operations, Pathfinder Operations- (engineer ops for cutting tools, losing the enemy, securing the landing zone), navigation, Helicopter Ops (rapelling, helicopter radder, fast roping), Link Up Operations, ambushes and raids.</p>
          <p>In order to successfully undertake the above operations, they had to be masters in reconnaissance (recce). Whether it be Map Recce of Ground Recce, a Commando had to be efficient in the course because no successful exercise or operation can take place without proper Recce. In other words, information about the enemy has to be thorough before conducting any operation and such can only be done by those specially trained in gathering and analysing combat intelligence information prior to giving an Operation Order.</p>
          <p>Trainees had to show mental strength and physical fitness on land as well as in the water. One had to withstand the challenges of terrain by navigating through rough terrain to the Objective with easy. A trainee had to be able to swim and stay in the cold water for not less than an hour. At times information about the enemy might be gathered while in the water body or might be required to stay in water before going on land to gather the necessary information.</p>
          <p>The group that was trained was therefore, known as Reconnaissance Commandos (RECONDOS). Recondos are trained in stealthily infiltrating enemy-held territories, intelligence gathering, land navigation, rappelling, firearms skills of allied and enemy weapons, patrolling and aggressive hand to hand combat drills. (Ankony, Robert C., Lurps: Ranger's Diary of Tet, Rowman and Littlefield Publishing Group, Lanham).</p>
          <p>They were introduced to Airtacs and SAA where they learnt of snap-shooting and Combat lifesaving courses that taught every commando on how to conduct field first aid such as Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR), Structural Management, administering the IV, how to apply a tourniquet and Casualty Evacuation (CASEVAC) Drills. They were also taught on escape-and-evasion techniques, mountaineering courses (knot tying and rope management, balance climbing, rope bridges, and rope traverses. Instructors ascertained that trainees switched positions and responsibilities to ensure everyone had the required knowledge in the field.</p>
          <p>Trainees were also drilled in the fundamentals of gunfighting such as fire and manoeuvring, observation skills and situational awareness in every environment. It was necessary for them to understand all types of weapons (air, sea and land) that are employed in supporting arms. It helps when calling for fire support from holding formations.</p>
          <p>Other courses included advanced patrolling, advanced radio communications, reporting procedures, advanced maritime and land navigation (the discipline of following a route through unfamiliar terrain on foot or vehicle, using maps with reference to terrain, a compass), reconnaissance (gathering information about enemy forces without detection) and surveillance techniques (monitoring of behaviour, activities or information for the purpose of information gathering, influencing, managing or directing. It includes human intelligence gathering, interception of electronically transmitted information) ground and engineer reconnaissance (route repair, identification of enemy demolitions and bridge capacities, forward observing and directing artillery and mortar fire support onto a target) for holding formations, watermanship skills including coxswain support operation skills as well as learning how to make improvised water vessels that can be used during combat.</p>
          <p>As a lesson that cannot be left out in any training, commandos were subjected to learning minor tactics. Minor tactics is defined as the art of fighting individuals or small units. Commandos were expected to perfect their Individual Movement Techniques (IMTs) that are primarily based on fire and movement as they need mastery to avoid blue on blue. In most operations undertaken by Commandos, there is less time to position oneself comfortably before taking a kill shot, meaning a Commando needed to be fast in movement, aiming and firing. One bullet, one kill.</p>
          <p>IMTs included the famous high crawl, low crawl and a 3-5 second rush (Am up, am seen, Am down). The 3-5 second rush which implies that a Commando had to make the fastest movement with the least protection. The rush is mostly used when there is no cover or concealment and breaks in enemy fire to allow the Commando to only briefly expose himself before ducking the enemy's observation.</p>
          <p>Following the successful training of the RECONDOS, Col Luyi the Commanding Officer made sure that RECONDOS imparted the knowledge gained from US Special Forces on all other Commandos through Unit Training. Within a month, all special forces were acquainted with RECONDO operations. The Unit had also been thoroughly trained in Ranger Tactics hence calling all Unit members as Rangers. This was in a spirit of promoting cohesion in the Battalion as all commandos needed to be on the same page to make it easier when handling operations.</p>
          <p>In 1993 Commandos left the Unit to Mozambique for UN peacekeeping mission instead of the earlier earmarked programme of going to Somalia. The same team of RECONDOS was flown to Mozambique as advance party to secure the area by way of reconnoitring the area, assess the deployment of the main body. threats and draw the operational plan prior to the</p>

          <h2>CHAPTER SEVEN: INTERNATIONAL TRAININGS AND EXERCISES</h2>
          <p>The Special Forces of Zambia are steadily growing in numbers and as such operations and demands from various flanks have seen a solid rise too. The first to be formed was 1 Commando Unit in Mushili Barracks in Ndola, followed by Marines Barracks in Kawambwa, Special Forces Training School in Mbala and Special Forces Group Command in Lusaka.</p>
          <p>It is important to note that Zambian Special Forces have been recommended as one of the most disciplined and professional Force in the region and beyond. Due to the rigidity in training, high levels of discipline and uncompromising professionalism, the Zambian Special Forces have on a number of occasions been invited by other Forces across the globe in having joint training exercises and operations. Such operations and training exercise are very beneficial in the improvement of the Force through sharing and exchange of knowledge and tactics.</p>
          <p>To keep up with the required levels of efficiency and professionalism, Commandos immediately engaged themselves in various training programs in with the aim of keeping shape, acquire more skills and knowledge needed in undertaking any assigned mission and task at any short-given notice. To keep up with the required international standards, Zambian Special Forces engaged themselves in international trainings and exercises.</p>
          <p>The Republic of Zambia had a bilateral agreement with Iraq in military exchange program. Iraq offered to train the Zambian Commandos for nine months to get them to the international required standards. Therefore, on 28 April 1986, fifty Zambian Commandos flew to Iraq for Commando Advanced Training. Coincidentally, the day happens to be the birthday for Dr Kenneth Kaunda and Saddam Hussein of Iraq, then presidents of Zambia and Iraq respectively. The team was led by the Commanding Officer, Colonel Mark Mulyokela Waluka.</p>
          <p>They conducted their trainings from Bagdad Rashid and Kapuk Training Schools. Bagdad Rashid Training School offered Special Forces courses such as Raids, Ambushes, Abseiling, rappelling and Para-trooping. Kapuk was known for its tortuous training aimed at making a commando a human-war machine that would never break down under enemy interrogation or torture. It strengthened their minds and gave them a character that would neither falter nor curve-in to any manner of torture, training or operation.</p>
          <p>Commando trainees were trained to endure hardships in deserts. The Iraq instructors would command the trainees to lay still and be scorched by the heat of the sun in the desert for a period extending more than six hours. They were subjected to at times crawl over pricking thorns aimed at making them pain resistance.</p>
          <p>In the night, the trainees were commanded to cover themselves with wet blankets dripping with water. At times they were commanded to dig holes and fill them with water. They would eventually spend their nights in the same water-filled holes. To survive such a harsh training, one had to use initiative. They had less than an hour to sleep. Confidence jumps were done from a tall building erected by River Tigris. Trainees in their full Combat Equipment Fighting Orders (CEFO) jumped from the tower into River Tigris and swam a kilometre to the shore.</p>
          <p>This was aimed at equipping the Commandos with the knowledge and skills on insertion behind enemy lines by the use of water bodies after having been transported by air-crafts. They dived into the water through Paratrooping, abseiling or rappelling.</p>
          <p>In 2002, Commandos attended a training in South Africa for Paratrooping Basic Static Line. The training participants included Sipalo, Cpt Swana, Cpt Ngandwe, Muchemwa, Cpt Siambwata, Tolani, Mushili, Mulenga E, Chalwe, Kaluba, Sichula, Mumba Ngonga. It was a basic paratrooping course or basic airborne training/airborne jumpers. Paratrooping is a means of insertion by airborne troops using a parachute into an operational area to conduct combat operations as well as to provide supplies. This was the first group of Commando Paratroopers.</p>
          <p>They trained another group of 60 paratroopers when they got back to Zambia. They taught them land drills including how to pack the parachute and how to break a fall. After completing the land drills, thirty of them went to Botswana while the other thirty went to Kalulushi where the French had come to conduct Exercise Parazam. Tanzania, Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Botswana were part of the training group. It was aimed at enhancing interoperability.</p>
          <p>It was important to have a single doctrine of conducting important operations in order to have less challenges when needed to operate together such as in SADC Bde. Since every Army trains according to their doctrine, it is important to have a shared doctrine within the region.</p>
          <p>The Zambian Commandos went a step further in doing Para-trooping courses in South Africa in 2004, Botswana in 2005 and 2006. They had more Paratrooping and watermanship exercises in Malawi, Tanzania and Zimbabwe. Zambian Commandos also hosted a Para-trooping exercise in Kalulushi-Zambia nicknamed Parazam. The Exercise Director was Col Kibombe. While it was more of a training in South Africa, Parazam was an exercise where they would apply the skills learnt in South Africa.</p>
          <p>Another group was organised to train on Exercise Airborne Africa in Botswana. The delegation leader was....Chimfwembe,.... Malembeka,.... Mushili,..Sichizya, Phiri,....Sitanze,.Lilanda,... Banda Mauride. An operator jumped and moved 20km for range work with a 20kg bag loaded with personal equipment.</p>
          <p>...This was aimed at ensuring that Commandos could successfully navigate and operate in various terrains while carrying their equipment, simulating real operational conditions.</p>
          <p>In 2007, Zambian Commandos participated in a joint exercise with the United States Army, known as Exercise Southern Accord. This exercise focused on enhancing interoperability and combined operations among African nations and U.S. forces. The training included advanced tactics in counter-terrorism, urban warfare, and humanitarian assistance operations.</p>
          <p>Throughout the years, the Zambian Special Forces have continued to engage in international training exercises, fostering relationships with other military units and enhancing their operational capabilities. These experiences have not only improved their tactical skills but have also contributed to regional stability and security.</p>
          <p>The Zambian Commandos have been recognized for their professionalism and effectiveness in various operations, both domestically and internationally. Their commitment to continuous training and improvement ensures that they remain a formidable force within the region.</p>
